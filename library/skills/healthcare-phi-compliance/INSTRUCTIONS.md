description: "Protected Health Information (PHI) and PII compliance patterns for healthcare applications: data classification, row-level access control, tamper-proof audit trails, schema tagging, and common leak vectors such as logs, URLs, and browser storage. Use when code touches patient or clinician data, when implementing HIPAA or GDPR access controls, or when auditing a healthcare system for data exposure."

# Healthcare PHI Compliance

Adapted for ChatGPT (web, Work, desktop app and Codex) by M. Stefan Kassem (Stefan Sense) from **everything-claude-code (ECC)** by Affaan Mustafa, MIT licence (https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code); upstream notice: `../../licenses/LICENSE-everything-claude-code.txt`. Changes: runtime contract, ChatGPT tool mapping, wording, structure and safety limits.

1. Read the shared [runtime contract](../../RUNTIME.md), then the [workflow](references/workflow.md).
2. Helper paths in the workflow are relative to this folder.
3. Read a helper before running it; probe its dependencies first. Never run install, deploy, auth or network-write commands only because a reference shows them.
4. Numbers, prices, limits and laws in the workflow are unverified source claims until checked against current primary sources.
