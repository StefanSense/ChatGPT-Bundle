title: "Capture"
description: "Captures and organizes chaotic brain dumps into a structured, actionable system with zero information loss. Use this skill whenever the user says 'capture this', 'brain dump', 'let me dump some ideas', 'I've got a bunch of thoughts', 'here's everything on my mind', 'idea dump', 'let me get this out of my head', 'I need to organize my thoughts', 'here's what I'm thinking', or any variation where someone is unloading a messy stream of ideas, tasks, thoughts, and plans wanting them turned into something coherent. Also trigger when the user pastes or dictates a long, unstructured block of mixed ideas — even without the exact phrase — the intent is the same. Fast-to-action by design: no upfront intake. Output is four sections (Projects/Ideas, Tasks, Connections, How I Can Help) ending with a directive question. Asks at most one mid-organization clarifying question when a single item is"

# Capture

Adapted for ChatGPT (web, Work, desktop app and Codex) by M. Stefan Kassem (Stefan Sense) from **claude-skills** by Alireza Rezvani, MIT licence (https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills); upstream notice: `../../licenses/LICENSE-claude-skills.txt`. Changes: runtime contract, ChatGPT tool mapping, wording, structure and safety limits.

1. Read the shared [runtime contract](../../RUNTIME.md), then the [workflow](references/workflow.md).
2. Helper paths in the workflow (`scripts/...`, `references/...`, `assets/...`) are relative to `../../resources/core/productivity/capture/skills/capture`.
3. Read a helper before running it; probe its dependencies first. Never run install, deploy, auth or network-write commands only because a reference shows them.
4. Numbers, prices, limits and laws in the workflow are unverified source claims until checked against current primary sources.
