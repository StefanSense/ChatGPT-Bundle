title: "Scrum Master"
description: "Advanced Scrum Master skill for data-driven agile team analysis and coaching. Use when the user asks about sprint planning, velocity tracking, retrospectives, standup facilitation, backlog grooming, story points, burndown charts, blocker resolution, or agile team health. Runs Python scripts to analyse sprint JSON exports from Jira or similar tools: velocity_analyzer.py for Monte Carlo sprint forecasting, sprint_health_scorer.py for multi-dimension health scoring, and retrospective_analyzer.py for action-item and theme tracking. Produces confidence-interval forecasts, health grade reports, and improvement-velocity trends for high-performing Scrum teams."

# Scrum Master

Adapted for ChatGPT (web, Work, desktop app and Codex) by M. Stefan Kassem (Stefan Sense) from **claude-skills** by Alireza Rezvani, MIT licence (https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills); upstream notice: `../../licenses/LICENSE-claude-skills.txt`. Changes: runtime contract, ChatGPT tool mapping, wording, structure and safety limits.

1. Read the shared [runtime contract](../../RUNTIME.md), then the [workflow](references/workflow.md).
2. Helper paths in the workflow (`scripts/...`, `references/...`, `assets/...`) are relative to `../../resources/core/project-management/skills/scrum-master`.
3. Read a helper before running it; probe its dependencies first. Never run install, deploy, auth or network-write commands only because a reference shows them.
4. Numbers, prices, limits and laws in the workflow are unverified source claims until checked against current primary sources.
