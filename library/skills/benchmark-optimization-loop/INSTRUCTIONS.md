title: "Benchmark Optimization Loop"
description: "Convert 'make it faster' requests into a bounded measured optimization loop — baseline first, generate one-hypothesis variants, benchmark each against a correctness gate, and promote the fastest safe variant with reproducible commands. Use when asked to speed something up, try many variants, run recursive optimization, benchmark latency/throughput/cost, or pick the best implementation by repeated measured tests."

# Benchmark Optimization Loop

Adapted for ChatGPT (web, Work, desktop app and Codex) by M. Stefan Kassem (Stefan Sense) from **everything-claude-code (ECC)** by Affaan Mustafa, MIT licence (https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code); upstream notice: `../../licenses/LICENSE-everything-claude-code.txt`. Changes: runtime contract, ChatGPT tool mapping, wording, structure and safety limits.

1. Read the shared [runtime contract](../../RUNTIME.md), then the [workflow](references/workflow.md).
2. Helper paths in the workflow are relative to this folder.
3. Read a helper before running it; probe its dependencies first. Never run install, deploy, auth or network-write commands only because a reference shows them.
4. Numbers, prices, limits and laws in the workflow are unverified source claims until checked against current primary sources.
